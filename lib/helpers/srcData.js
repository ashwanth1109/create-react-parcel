> by [Ashwanth A R](https://github.com/ashwanth1109)

Built with Parcel.
Note: Also has support for deploying your site to github pages.

Inspired by the 'nano-react-app' project by Adrian Li

### Booting Up

To create your simple react app, run:

> npx create-react-simple my-app

### Running the project

\`\`\`
cd my-app
npm start
\`\`\`

You can now view your project at \`http://localhost:1234\`

### Building the project

Before you can deploy your project to Github pages, you must first build your project. To build, run:

\`\`\`
npm run build
\`\`\`

This will generate a \`docs\` folder that will contain an index html file, src js file and src map file. It is called \`docs\` so that we can push it to Github pages for deployment.

### Pushing your github project

Skip this section if you know how to create a repo on github with your app.

We must first initialize our repo with:

\`\`\`
git init
\`\`\`

To add all your files and commit the changes:

\`\`\`
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial Commit'
\`\`\`

Then add your repo to a remote origin and push to Github:

\`\`\`
git remote add origin https://github.com/{YOUR_GITHUB_ID}/{YOUR_REPO_NAME}.git
git push -u origin master
\`\`\`

Note: Substitute your github id and repo name as appropriate.

### Deploying to github pages

To deploy to github pages, you must configure your repo's settings to publish your app.

To do that,

- Go to \`Settings\` tab in your repo
- Under \`GitHub Pages\` section, select your source as \`master branch/docs folder\`

You will see the page refresh with the following information:

\`\`\`
Your site is ready to be published at
https://{YOUR_GITHUB_ID}.github.io/{YOUR_GITHUB_NAME}/.
\`\`\`

Your app will be deployed at this URL. It can take anywhere between 20 mins to an hour before you can see this published.
